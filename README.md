# Server Rotation and Load Balancing Example !!!!!

This project showcase the working of LOAD BALANCER that how it devide the traffic and balance the load.
in this project have used various AWS services and there components like EC2, VPC, Load balancer, Target Group, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, etc

There is diffrent types of Load Balancer
- Application Load Balancer
- Gateway Load Balancer
- Network Load Balancer

The main highlight in this project is LOAD BALANCER
That how it will balance the load or we can say divide the traffic to multiple resources to reduce the downtime. In this project i have used the Application Load Balancer to balance the traffic. 

To create a Loab Balancer we have to create some components first like
- Target Group
- Security Group
- Configure the Instance Security Group's 


As shown in the video when multiple requests hit on the application or website then the LOAD BALANCER divided the traffic to the servers.

LOAD BALANCER working 
how the request shift from one server to another server.
